    In his book “Eating the big fish” Adam Morgan talks about how we should look at challenges with intelligent naivety. This at most times rings true that being in a category or an industry for so long, this causes us to actually think that our industry is unique and at most times we will miss the opportunities of doing things differently in order to stay competitive and being a leader. 

Inexperience when applied properly in the context of asking and trying to figure out answers to the challenges experienced by consumers can be a great source of innovation for a brand. This has always been true when we engage and work with agencies that assist us to see some obvious elements from a different perspective. So as we give a great start to what looks like a promising week, go out there and experience the brand that you serve with some intelligent naivety!

    title: "IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING A STRATEGY",
    image: "./images/t2.jpg",
    content: `
   Once you have that idea on a cool project or campaign that you can put together, it is easy to get lost in the execution which might not be informed by a strong and meaningful strategic insight. We are often in a rush to move, but without the strategic insight that will guide our actions, we risk having a messy execution that then becomes a bit hard to measure at the end. 

Most people always think about the logo, the website, the online store which are always great and exciting to do but not necessarily driven by a strategy. It’s like building a house without a plan and being in a rush to lay the foundation. 

There will always be a lot of things that we will need to figure out, this is the beauty of Marketing. What strategy does, it actually forces us to sit and carefully think about our approach and then have internal buy-in if that is the right strategic approach to take. 

Getting this right means;

·        Having clarity about your brand (who are you, what is the mission and vision) 
·        Having clarity about your business challenge
·        Having clarity about your customer and how they interact with you. 
·        Having clarity on how then will you execute your strategy?
·        Clarity on the measurement metrics. 

Let’s fix the error of our ways and get back to the basics when it comes to Marketing. `,

    title: "HOW TO ACTIVELY USE BRAND SENTIMENT IN YOUR STRATEGY",
    image: "./images/t3.jpg",
    content: `I have some good news this morning! The customer is always saying something about your brand, the question that you always need to ask yourself is whether or not you are listening? Now more than ever, it is very easy to use a reputable listening platform that will aid any marketer to understand the conversations that are being had about their brand. 

The platform is the simple part, the details comes in the application of the feedback that the customer is sharing. 

Armed with this insight, then you can look at practically doing the following;

·        Build a simple process that will allow you to address the negative sentiments
·        Make sure that for each negative sentiment, you put in twice the effort to resolve. 
·        Make sure that your social team has the required support in dealing with customer matters
·        When doing your brand strategy, add a slide that speaks to how you will address the customer sentiment that you have identified. 

Lastly, read other books that will help you make sense on how you can use sentiment analysis in driving your strategy. These are just some of the solutions, but you will need to read up on the rest.

    title: "HOW DO YOU GET TEAMS TO BUY IN TO YOUR STRATEGY?",
    image: "./images/t4.jpg",
    content: `We have seen it all before, where a visually drafted and well-presented strategy is put together amidst a lot of fanfare and excitements, and then as time goes by it seems like it needs a lot of convincing and buy-in internally to get it off the ground. 

At the core, is that when there is a level of compulsory execution on strategy, then the will power to execute is somehow forced and this then limits the momentum that it is able to get. We need to essentially always on these three pillars internally in order for strategy to have people that are happy to execute it and voluntarily cooperate with us. 

1.      Engagement – strategy needs us to engage internally and understand the views and challenges on the topic matter by the other departments. 
2.      Explanation – although it might be good to put out the strategy, we still need to properly explain our thinking and the direction internally to teams in order for them to add input if they align with us. 
3.      Clear expectations – we all function from a place of clarity, never underestimate the need for all sectors and members within the organization (especially the frontlines) in being clear about the expectations with your strategy. 

As marketers, we have a lot of internal stakeholders and we should always have on top of mind all the amazing people that are on the frontline in engaging with our customers. Those are the ones that need to really buy in to our strategy!

    title: "How do we build better customer insight?",
    image: "./images/t5.jpg",
    content: `We have all seen it very often, where we are in a rush to find solutions to our problems primarily because problems by their very nature always come to our attention when there is a short window period to find the solution. This scenario always causes tension between the need to figure out the customer insight with backed up research and the immediate need to find a solution. 

As Marketers, we need to then develop a framework that will enable us to be constantly trying the figure out the customer and the insights they provide on a regular basis, this will mean that when the different challenges and scenarios are thrown at us we will have the ability to react with speed. Practically we need to look at the following;

1.      Research and Insights needs to be driven as a regular exercise, biweekly or monthly

2.      You need to develop very strong research and insights capabilities in-house or drive with your agency partner. 

3.      Knowing your customer is important, so data must be collected at the different stages of the customer Journey. 

4.      The use of technology allows us to consistently review feedback from our customers and use that as a base for innovation. 

5.      More importantly, research needs to be well applied back into your Marketing or brand improvements in order for this to be very meaningful. `,

    content: `There is this magical place that exists, when all the ingredients for effective Marketing come together. That marriage between brand and sales, where brand assists the sales teams in getting the brand awareness out there and ensuring that the sales team live up to the brand promise. 

I have read a lot of articles when I have seen the tension that exists between sales and brand, where the one does not understand the other properly and as such does not work together. What remains true is that we all sell a brand, and sales makes that possible. It is important for these two to work together in harmony in order for sales of the brand to be effectively made.

    image: "./images/t8.jpg",
    content: `Marketing teams work hard in educating customers about the brand promise, which is essentially what they are promising potential clients will happen when they purchase the brand. This makes sense and is the right thing to do. 

What we need to do and take an extra step on is educating the teams internally, especially the customer facing teams to understand the brand promise and help Marketing in delivering what they originally set out to do. 

Key things that we can do to educate internally on the brand promise

1.      Align the organization to your brand values 

2.      Get your teams to understand the brand personality and see the brand as a being

3.      Empower your teams to be able to solve customer challenges using the brand values. 

4.      Rewards moments where customers are happy with the brand living up to its promise. 

5.      Always measure the brand experience at every possible touch point. 

Although the five points above might not be the silver bullet to living up to your brand promise, it certainly will go a long way in helping your teams live up to the promise.
