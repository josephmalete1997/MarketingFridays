    In his book “Eating the big fish” Adam Morgan talks about how we should look at challenges with intelligent naivety. This at most times rings true that being in a category or an industry for so long, this causes us to actually think that our industry is unique and at most times we will miss the opportunities of doing things differently in order to stay competitive and being a leader. 

Inexperience when applied properly in the context of asking and trying to figure out answers to the challenges experienced by consumers can be a great source of innovation for a brand. This has always been true when we engage and work with agencies that assist us to see some obvious elements from a different perspective. So as we give a great start to what looks like a promising week, go out there and experience the brand that you serve with some intelligent naivety!

    title: "IMPORTANCE OF BUILDING A STRATEGY",

   Once you have that idea on a cool project or campaign that you can put together, it is easy to get lost in the execution which might not be informed by a strong and meaningful strategic insight. We are often in a rush to move, but without the strategic insight that will guide our actions, we risk having a messy execution that then becomes a bit hard to measure at the end. 

Most people always think about the logo, the website, the online store which are always great and exciting to do but not necessarily driven by a strategy. It’s like building a house without a plan and being in a rush to lay the foundation. 

There will always be a lot of things that we will need to figure out, this is the beauty of Marketing. What strategy does, it actually forces us to sit and carefully think about our approach and then have internal buy-in if that is the right strategic approach to take. 

Getting this right means;

·        Having clarity about your brand (who are you, what is the mission and vision) 
·        Having clarity about your business challenge
·        Having clarity about your customer and how they interact with you. 
·        Having clarity on how then will you execute your strategy?
·        Clarity on the measurement metrics. 

Let’s fix the error of our ways and get back to the basics when it comes to Marketing. `,
